Python Challenge - is a project that I develop together with my friends at work to learn Python. This is a collection of simple Python challenges that doesn't have much of an impact on humanity.

**App 2 - Banker**

The application has 2 main functions:
1. Viewing currency rates
2. PLN/FOREIGN_CURRENCY calculator.

If the user selects 1., the program asks for the name of the currency for which the rate is to be checked. 
After selecting the currency, it asks whether to display the average for the given day (yesterday's) or to display the list of the last 10 currency rates.

If the user selects 2, the program asks for the name of the currency to be converted, and then for the value to be converted. 
The default currency for conversion is PLN.

I use the API of the National Bank of Poland: http://api.nbp.pl/.
